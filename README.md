# Background-Services-Example

This repository provides a simple example of background service implementation in a .NET application.

## BackgroundServiceDemo Class

The `BackgroundServiceDemo` class is a demonstration of a background service in a .NET application. It inherits from the abstract class `BackgroundService`, offering a foundation for executing background tasks in a hosted environment.

## HostedService Interface Implementation

The repository includes the `HostedServiceDemo` class, which implements the `IHostedService` interface. This interface, part of the ASP.NET Core framework, is used for long-running tasks within the application's lifetime.

## HostedServiceLifecycleServiceDemo Interface Implementation

Additionally, the repository introduces the `HostedServiceLifecycleServiceDemo` class, implementing the `IHostedLifecycleService` interface. This interface extends hosted services by providing methods for starting and stopping the service with lifecycle events.
